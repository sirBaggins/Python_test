# RIDDLED

This project is a game, built on top of Python's 3.12.4, using a framework called PyGame, which has been around for about 20 years.

## GAME CONCEPT
The game concept is a 'Graphic Novel'-ish game on which you play as someone who just died and will be tested for purity of heart. The tests are simple existential riddles. The Gatekeeper has three guardians on which will conduct the exams.

## ART
- Music made by me, @sirBaggins
- Images generated by OpenArt AI.
- Riddles randomly selected.


## HOW TO PLAY
1) Make sure you have Python installed and updated.
2) Go to ```/Kodland_Python/``` and run ``` pip install -r requirements.txt```
3) Move to ```/src/code/``` and run ```python main.py```

### Character names:
- The Man -> Guardian of the passage
     - The Crow -> Warrior of the past
     - The Dog -> Warrior of the present
     - The Dragon -> Warrior of the future



# Riddles:
## Level 1 - The past:  
1) I am a place where time stands still,  
But I am not a clock or a mill.  
I hold the echoes of what has been,  
In pages where old stories are seen.  
What am I?  
(book)

2) I am what you can never reclaim,
A precious resource that’s never the same.
You spend me and use me, but can’t hold me tight,
I pass by unseen, both day and night.
What am I?  
(time)

3) I am the shadow of what once was here,
A memory that may bring a smile or a tear.
Though I’m not present, I shape who you are,
I’m the story you tell, no matter how far.
What am I?  
(the past)

## Level 2 - The present

1) I am a day that’s unfolding right now,
Filled with moments that you can’t disavow.
Though I’m just a fraction of the passing time,
I’m all you have as you live and climb.
What am I?  
(now)

2) I reflect what you see and feel in the now,
Yet I am not the moment, but a way to endow.
I capture the essence of what’s happening today,
In a form that can linger and never decay.
What am I?  
(record)

3) I am the moment that you’re living right now,  
Unseen yet experienced, a gift and a vow.  
I am fleeting and constant, always in view,  
What am I, that’s both old and new?  
(present) 


## Level 3 - The future
1) I stretch before you, vast and wide,  
An endless road where dreams reside.  
With every step, I shift and change,  
Yet in one place, I always remain.  
What am I, guiding every stride?  
(horizon)

2) I hold the keys to what’s ahead,  
Though you can’t see me, I'm often read.  
I map your hopes, your fears, your plans,  
But in my pages, nothing stands.  
What am I, that shapes your days?  
(calendar)  

3) I am a shadow that never leaves,  
A path unknown that time weaves.  
I hold secrets yet to be seen,  
What am I, where dreams convene?  
(future)
